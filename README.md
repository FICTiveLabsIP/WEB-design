# WEB-design

Every branch is a unique variant (Example: "01" stands for the first variant.)
If the branch already exists, name the branch through the dot syntax (Example: "01.0" stands for alternative first variant.)

All the needed images or descriptions you should link to Readme.md. 
Materials needed in the process of learning you should place under Misc branch.

Master branch contains only readme and all the relevant information about the repository, subject etc.
